# Peephole AI

This repository will contain all the code necessary to train and run a single-face detection and recognition model. I personally intend to use it for unlocking my dormitory door with my face, but you may do with it what you will.

## Downloading Data

The data used to train the face detection model can be downloaded to your current working directory by running the following in the terminal:
```
python download_data
```
The data can also be downloaded from https://zenodo.org/records/14474899.
